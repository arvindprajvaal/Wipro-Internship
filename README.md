I have Used open source datasets from Kaggle to build an Employee Attrition Model and implemented 6 Classification Models and got An Accuracy of 76% Max

I also used another open source dataset to build a Sales Prediction Regression Model and got my Top Models as Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor with both of them giving high R2_score and low RMSE Scores
